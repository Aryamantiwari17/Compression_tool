# Compression_tool
Introduction:
In the current digital era, data storage, and transmission have become an integral part of our lives. However,  with the increasing volume of data, it becomes challenging to store and transmit data efficiently. This project aims to develop a Compression Tool that can compress large and different formats of files efficiently,  reducing their storage size. 

Objectives: 
1. To develop an efficient Compression Tool that can compress large files into smaller ones without losing data integrity. 
2. To ensure that the tool is user-friendly, intuitive, and easy for users. 
3. To have compression time analysis.
4. Use of Huffman encoding algorithm for the compression and decompression.//add only text file
5. The project has proper error handling mechanisms to handle all kind of errors.

Technologies: 
1. C++ programming language used to develop the tool. 
2. Visual Studio IDE used for development. 
3. Windows OS target platform for the tool.
